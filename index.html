<h1 id="headline">THE RISING HEAT WILL HIT HARDER IN POOR DISTRICTS IN NYC</h1>
<h2 id="subhead">A disproportionate and deadly exposure to heat waves reveals the poor urban planning in the city that forces low-income residents to deal with the highest temperatures in the city.  </h2>

The number of days over 90 degrees in New York City is going to double by 2080 according to the New York City Panel on Climate Change. This will represent a risk to the health of its population, but the temperatures will hit harder to low-income district residents whose communities are surrounded by constructions that retain and reflect sun heat at higher temperatures than their district neighbors. That result: A higher risk of death, heat strokes, and other heat-related illnesses on the public health in neighborhoods where black and brown population are the majority.

<p>
Scarce green areas with a contrast of predominant grey paved lots, commercial traffic, and industries with industrial waste create higher temperatures over time in these areas where the median household income is below the   <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork/HSG010221">city's avergae income</a>, so access to get an A/C or to afford energy bills is limited.
</p>
“There are about 3.4 million New Yorkers that are living in these heat-vulnerable areas,” said Leanne Spaulding, senior policy advisor of NYC Climate and Environmental Justice. In response to the poor environmental city planning, Spaulding added, “There is a history that [NYC has] with systemic and justice racism that we have to acknowledge. That is led to certain communities being in housing and communities that have been disinvested over time leading to poorer public health outcomes”.
</p>

<p>NYC Health Department developed The NYC Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) in order to identify populations at more risk for dying during and immediately following extreme heat. This tool, which scale goes from 1 (lower risk) to 5 (highest risk) uses a statistical model to group factors such as access to cooling areas, race, income, surface temperature, and vegetative covers in each district. All neighborhoods have residents at risk for high temperatures, warns the NYC Department of Health. The areas ranked with 5 present the highest limitation to resources to protect public health facing heat impacts.
